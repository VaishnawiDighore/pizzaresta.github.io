    <p>The second fry gives the potato that gorgeous golden hue and completes the cooking process so you don’t end up with al dente finger chips. For best results, use potatoes that have a high starch content. Russet potatoes, Yukon Gold potatoes, Idaho potatoes and Maris Piper are all good choices to make crispy yet tender french fries.

    <p> -French fries are cut potatoes which are deeply fried. It could be prepared in the home which might differ in the way of making but is regarded to be healthy</p>
    <p> -Seasoning home-cooked French fries with garlic is an easy way to make them more gourmet, and garlic fries are a popular menu item in restaurants too. Most versions toss just-cooked fries with sautéed minced garlic and finely chopped parsley, but you can substitute dried garlic and parsley too. Many versions boost the flavor further by adding Parmesan cheese along with the garlic and parsley.</p>
    <p> -Take cheese fries one step further and add a layer of tasty chili between the fries and cheese. It could be a beef, turkey or vegetarian chili, from a can or homemade. Additional topping options include diced raw onions and hot sauce. You definitely need a fork and a pile of napkins to enjoy this potentially messy treat, which could be a substantial, shareable side dish or a full entrée on its own.</p>
    <p> -Crinkle-cut fries are just like regular fries, usually on the thicker side, but with wavy or crinkly sides and edges. They’re often served in restaurants and you can buy and bake frozen crinkle-cut fries, but it’s also possible to make the real thing at home from scratch. You just need a special crinkle cutter or a crinkle-cutting blade on a mandolin to cut russet-type potatoes into the signature shape. Deep-fry or bake these types of French fries as a fun alternative to regular fries.</p>
